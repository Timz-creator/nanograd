# Nanograd: Autograd Engine from First Principles

A minimal autograd engine built to understand the mechanics behind PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Implements backpropagation on a dynamically built computational graph.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand automatic differentiation deeply
- Implement backpropagation from scratch
- Build computational graphs
- Train neural networks without frameworks


## 📚 Resources

- [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)


Building this as preparation for:
- AI Safety research understanding
- Deep learning fundamentals
- Robotics
